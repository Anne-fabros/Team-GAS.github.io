                        <p class="unstyled"><b>Streaming</b> refers to a multimedia file such as audio and video that can be instantly played without the need to download it first. A media content, recorded or live, can be considered a streamed content as long as it can be played on any device via the internet even if you do not download it. It works through a continuous transmission of the media content from a server to the client. The following are the most common forms of streamed content:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Video Game</b></li>

                        <p class="unstyled"><b>Live Streaming</b> is a broadcast that allows you to watch or listen to media content in real time. It is different in those pre-recorded streamed contents in terms of your capacity to control how you want to watch it; you can easily pause the pre-recorded content and still go back to where you left it. However, in livestreams, you can pause it but you cannot go back to where you left it, as it happens real time. The following are some examples of public and private live streaming applications:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facebook Live</li>

                      <li><b>What are their needs?</b> - Based on our research, music helps adolescents release or control emotions and helps coping with difficult situations such as peer pressure, substance abuse, pressures of study and family, the dynamics of friendships and social life, and the pain of loss or abuse. Teens tend to gravitate to music that describes what they are feeling and what is important to them. Music helps teens explore ideas and emotions in a safe way and express themselves without words. Exposure to positive influences through music can help teens learn coping mechanisms and appropriate responses to stressful situations. Music also helps teens connect to social groups and gain a feeling of belonging.</li>

                       <li><b>Music</b> - According to a survey of 2020, more women than men listened to music every day in their free time. As reported by the data, 38% of female respondents claimed to listen to music every day. We have all heard it said that music is the universal language of the world and for a good reason.

     <p class="family"><b>IV. Why People of different statuses listen to music</b></p>
     <ul>
      <li>Aside from music being a universal language that allows people to enjoy it despite the language barrier, people also listen to music because it allows the listener to feel varying emotions such as being relaxed, cool, hyped, happy, sad, and etc. it is also a great way to bond with friends or make new ones through music, not only that another reason why people like music is because it allows them to truly express themselves they normally wouldnâ€™t be able to, not to mention that music has been a part of human civilization for a long time now in the form of ritualistic music or religious music and is one of the most common similarities all humans have which becomes a bridge for communication, music is also innate to humans as people at a very young age are usually exposed to music and one of the ways to communicate with toddlers people usually use music and this allows something to spark in them which will eventually grow into a love for music (for more detailed information look into the hypothesis and theory article The Human Nature of Music).</li>

     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p class="family"><b>V. Characteristics of a Good Stream</b></p>
     <ul>
      <li>To have a good stream, the stream should have a good streamer. Having a good streamer can really affect the result of the stream for example, the streamer is good at creating new or unique content for the viewers to watch. The stream should be appropriate, what I mean by appropriate is that it should be pg. The streamer should be honest and respectful to the viewers. And the streamer or the creator should know what they are getting into and they have the passion to do streaming.</li>
